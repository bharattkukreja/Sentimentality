# Sentimentality
### Know how twitter feels

Ever wondered what's going on around twitter. Want to know how twitter is feeling about a certain issue?
Sentimentality fetches tweets about the phrase user enters and analyses it and displays on the screen interactively the public's sentiment on twitter.

I build this with Node and Express and made use of Twitter's Streaming API's.
This app uses a service oriented architecture.
